## 📋 Introduction

This repository contains a collection of custom GitHub Actions that I use to simplify and optimize my CI/CD pipelines
across various projects. These actions help automate common tasks, streamline workflows, and save time during
development and deployment.

## 🚀 Why Use These Actions?

- **Simplified automation**: Streamlines repetitive tasks in your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Reusable**: Modular actions that can be easily integrated into any project.
